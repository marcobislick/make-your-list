# MakeYourlist!
MakeYourlist! is a python GUI made with Tkinter. This is a personal project with no commercial intentions, the idea was to practice and test my skills.

With MakeYourList! you can:

-Add items into a list.
-Sort the list A-Z.
-Remove items from the list.
-Clear the list and start over.
-Load text files from custom and/or defaultpath.
-Delete text files located in custom and/or defaultpath.
-Save lists into external text file in custom and/or defaultpath with custom names.

Feel free to colaborate or comment on my code, also, feel free to use my code on your own educational projects.
